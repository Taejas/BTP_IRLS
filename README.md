# Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares with Decorrelation for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks

This repository contains the scripts for inferring gene regulatory networks from time series gene expression datasets using **iteratively reweighted least squares with decorrelation**.

A detailed explanation of my work and results can be found in [`Report.pdf`](Report.pdf).

The scripts that utilize a particle swarm optimization based RNN approach for the same task can be found in the following repository:
